# CHANGELOG

## 1.2.0
- Persist keys when jumping between models, this speeds up the ability to test different models
- When `set` is called but not previously user (ie no api key found) it will ask
- `config-clear` added to clear all persisted config data

## 1.1.1 && 1.1.2
Docs

## 1.1.0
- Run `--help` to see all options
- Google gemini added, run `ls` to see models and `set` to use
- Split out the streaming functions into own files, the single cli.js was getting too long
